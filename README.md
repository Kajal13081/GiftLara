## Problem Statement : Algorithms

Demonstrate through your app the different kinds of algorithms that a web-streaming app (like Netflix) or an audio-streaming app (like Spotify) may use for their Recommendation Engine.

## About The App

This is a gift recommendation android application which works on certain algorithms.
Various algorithms which have been used while building this app are Searching, Sorting and Greedy Algorithm. 
- Users can filter and choose gifts depending on their mood, color, age, events and occasions, price etc.
- Then gifts will be recommended on the basis of the filters applied. After that users can sort these gifts according to their name, price, rating in ascending or descending order.
- Also users can search for a specific gift (without using any filter) and then they will be recommended other related gifts.
- They can greedily sort the gift combos and packs according to their price and quantity.
